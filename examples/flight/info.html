    The original purpose of this example is to demonstrate is how ui-widgets can be 
    dependent upon each other's state. This is a non-question in Hyperapp, since 
    all widgets technically share the same single state, and all widgets are  
    updated simultaneously.

    This example does still give you an idea of how to create forms with 
    validation. Also, it shows you our first example of using an effect to  
    "submit" the form. (the alert popup)
