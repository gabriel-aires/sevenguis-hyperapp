<h1>Dynamic Timer</h1>

<p>
    The reason for including this task in the 7GUIs is to demonstrate 
    how concurrent processes can interact with the UI. In javascript there 
    is of course no concurrency per se. The nearest equivalent is the concept 
    of "asynchronous event streams".  
</p>

<p>
    In Hyperapp, the way to interact with asynchronous event streams is to 
    use a subscription. In this case we use the <code>every</code> subscription 
    to dispatch an action every x milliseconds. That is how we keep track of the 
    remaining time in the timer. The subscription is switched on and 
    off depending on if the timer should be running or not.
