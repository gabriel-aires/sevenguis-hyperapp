<h1>Circle Drawer</h1>

<p>
    This task demonstrates how to draw custom graphics and interact 
    with them. As we are on the web, SVG is the natural solution.  
</p>

<p> 
    This example is also intended to demonstrate how to manage an 
    undo-history for the app. Hyperapp's architecture with a single,   
    global state makes this quite easy. I wrapped the <code>collection-store.js</code> 
    state helpers in histor helpers to create <code>history-collection-store.js</code>  
</p>

<p> 
    Another thing demonstrated here is how to present a modal dialog. The modal needs 
    to keep track of some local state (if it is being dragged, for example), so it simultaneously an example 
    of integrating a component which requires some local state, by "wiring". 
    (Read more about this technique in my 
    <a href="https://dev.to/zaceno/modular-hyperapp-part-1-7f6">series about modular hyperapp</a>)

    One final thing to note. I use the <code>onResize</code> subscription to detect layout 
    changes, in order to adjust the <code>viewBox</code> of the <code>svg</code> element, so 
    that it fills the available width. The <code>getRect</code> effect calls back an action 
    with the rect of the element at the given selector.
