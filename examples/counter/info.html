<h1>Counter</h1>

<p> 
    The humble counter is perhaps the most basic of all UIs. It demonstrates the 
    core architecture of Hyperapp: how thew view is a declarative function of 
    the state, and how actions which transform the state are dispatched in 
    response to user interactions with the dom.
