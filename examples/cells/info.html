<h1>Cells: Dynamic & interdependent data</h1>

<p>
    This app is a sort of basic spreadsheet application, intended 
    to demonstrate a more complex, real-world use case. 
</p>

<p>    
    Each cell can hold 
    a value or it can have a value that depends on other cells via a formula, 
    for example <code>=SUM(C1:C5)</code>.  There could be cells dependent on cells 
    in multiple layers. One of the constraints on the task, is that cells should not be calculated 
    unless one of their dependencies has changed. This would make reactive state 
    management tools like RX.js streams or Knockout's observables especially suitable. 
</p>

<p>
    Unfortunately those tools are based on having mutable instances of data, which 
    doesn't work well with immutable state management such Hyperapp uses (similar to Redux). 
    For this reason I implemented <code>reactive-store.js</code> – a library of immutable 
    state management helpers that allow you to implement a structure similar to those reactive 
    libraries. Each time a value is set in the store, any dependent values are recalculated. 
</p>

<p>
    The cells-store is based on this reactive store. I wired it together with 
    an editable-table-component similar to how the modal was wired in the circles example.
