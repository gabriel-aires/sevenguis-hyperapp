<h1>Create, Read, Update & Delete</h1>

    The CRUD task is intended to demonstrate how to lay out user 
    interfaces. Since we are on the web, CSS is used for layout and 
    there is plenty of information on CSS layouts elsewhere.

    For Hyperapp, though, what is interesting about this challenge is  
    managing state for a collection of data-records. It is a common enough 
    use-case that I have created a separate library of functions for managing 
    record collections (<code>collection-store.js</code>). This example 
    demonstrates how to integrate such helpers with the app's actions.
