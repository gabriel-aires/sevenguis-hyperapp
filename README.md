7GUIs with Hyperapp
====================

See it in action at [https://zaceno.github.io/sevenguis-hyperapp/](https://zaceno.github.io/sevenguis-hyperapp/)

[7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) is a series
of seven gui-applications, each posing unique
challenges to front-end/GUI development. The goal of their project
is to catalog implementations of the seven tasks in a large variety
of frameworks, in order to showcase how those challenges
can be solved with that particular framework.

This is an implementation to the seven tasks using Hyperapp v2
(currently in beta). [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp)
is a javascript front-end micro-framework
featuring a fast vdom implementation, built in state management and
declarative subscriptions. Inspired by Elm, it is heavily slanted
toward the functional and declarative paradigm.
